Learning to 3d by doing and porting.

The Math For Game Developer's series engine structure was easy enough to lift.
There were some modifications though:

- 100% C
- Based on OpenGL 3.2 (latest in OS X 10.8)
  - Forces VBO management. (needs more work)
- SDL
- GLEW - to load extensions.
  - This makes error rotines useless due to a bug :(
- Backed by my horrible math library
  -  most of the learning goes here.
