:warning: DOES NOT WORK :warning:

Learning to 3d by doing and porting. Simple OpenGL 4.5 context with SDL2 and
GLEW 2 for cross platform Window and extension management.

This project will try and still to C because it's an itch I want to scratch.

There is no real aim other than a simple starting point for getting pixels to
the screen with a modern OpenGL pipeline.

Currently the only thing this program does is render a triangle and will exit
once the escape is pressed.
